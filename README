Intro
-----

A small script for running simulations with dice throws, including situations
where you get multiple rerolls and can decide which dice to keep or reroll.

Usage
-----

usage: dice.py [-h] [-n NUM] [-s SIDES] [-ss [SIDES [SIDES ...]]] [-r REROLL]
               [--keep {test,sixes,none,unique}]
               [--stats [{test,count_unique,none,sum,count_sixes}]]
               [-N simulations] [--counts]

Simulating various dice throw situations.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NUM                Specify the number of dice to throw.
  -s SIDES              Specify the number of sides all dice have.
  -ss [SIDES [SIDES ...]]
                        Specify the number of sides for each individual die.
  -r REROLL             Perform multiple rerolls (stats only count last roll).
  --keep {test,sixes,none,unique}
                        Choose a keeping strategy when performing rerolls.
  --stats [{test,count_unique,none,sum,count_sixes}]
                        Performs multiple throws and outputs cumulative
                        results. Provide a parameter to choose an approach for
                        reducing a dice throw to a single value of interest.
  -N simulations        Set the number of simulations to run for statistical
                        results.
  --counts              Print actual event counts instead of percentages in
                        the statistical results.


Terminology
-----------
* Keep strategy: 
  a strategy used to decide which dice to keep between rerolls
* Reduction function: 
  a function for reducing a dice throw result to a single value of interest
